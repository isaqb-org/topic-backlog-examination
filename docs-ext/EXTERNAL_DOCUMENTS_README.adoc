Copy translated versions (PDF) of the topic backlog (other than German or English) to the directory `docs-ext`.

Please make sure, that the file name is well-formed and complies with the following format:

`topic-backlog-expert-level-lc.pdf`

`lc`: iso language code of the translation, e.g. `es` (Spanish) or `pt` (Portuguese)

Example: `topic-backlog-expert-level-es.pdf` <- Spanish version of the WEB curriculum.

**ATTENTION:** For every document that you add to `docs-ext`, you also have to create an entry in `index.adoc`
so that people can access it from the overview page of this curriculum.
